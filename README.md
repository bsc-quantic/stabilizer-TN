Stabilizer Tensor Networks: Universal Quantum Simulator on a Basis of Stabilizer States

Public release of code, v1.1

The main class to use is "gen_clifford", a generalization inheriting Qiskit's "Clifford" class. This and other supporting functions can be found in stabilizers.py. 
The stabilizers.ipynb file is an example in notebook format on its utilization, as well as the code lines to produce the figure in the main text of https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08724.
